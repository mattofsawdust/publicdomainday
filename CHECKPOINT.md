# PublicDomainDay Project Checkpoint

**Date: March 10, 2025 (Updated)**

## Current Status

The PublicDomainDay application is now in a stable, working state with the following key features implemented:

1. **Image Repository**
   - Responsive image grid with detailed image views
   - Public domain image hosting and sharing
   - Metadata management (titles, descriptions, authors, years, tags)
   - AI-powered image analysis for automatic tagging and descriptions

2. **User System**
   - Basic user authentication with JWT
   - User profiles with metadata
   - Analytics for image views and likes

3. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Complete admin interface for image management
   - Image editing with metadata and tag management
   - Batch upload functionality
   - Description editor for individual images

## Architecture

The application consists of two main components:

1. **React Frontend (Port 3001 in development)**
   - Modern React with hooks and context for state management
   - Styled Components for UI styling
   - React Router for client-side routing
   - Axios for API communication

2. **Express Backend (Port 5001 in development)**
   - RESTful API for data operations
   - MongoDB for data storage
   - Multer for file uploads
   - JWT for authentication
   - Optional S3 integration for cloud storage

## Recent Fixes

- Fixed cross-origin (CORS) issues for image uploads
- Resolved issues with direct navigation to React Router routes
- Improved error handling and debugging for image uploads
- Added server-side redirects for admin routes
- Enhanced Content Security Policy for better security
- Fixed port configuration to ensure proper client-server communication

## Running the Application

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd publicdomainday/server
   npm start
   ```

2. **Start the frontend development server:**
   ```bash
   cd publicdomainday/client
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - Main website: http://localhost:3001
   - Admin dashboard: http://localhost:3001/admin
   - API endpoint: http://localhost:5001/api

## Next Steps

2. Improve search functionality with more advanced filters
3. Add user collections/folders for organization
4. Implement better mobile responsiveness

## Backup

A backup script has been created (`backup.sh`) that captures:
- Source code (excluding node_modules)
- Uploaded images
- Database content (if mongodump is available)

Run the backup script to create a timestamped checkpoint:
```bash
bash backup.sh
```
